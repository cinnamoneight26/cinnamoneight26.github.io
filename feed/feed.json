      "title": "Why I Switched from Jekyll to 11ty",
      "content_html": "<h1 id=\"why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-11ty\">Why I Switched from Jekyll to 11ty <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-11ty\"></a></h1>\n<h2 id=\"1.-comparing-the-basics-of-jekyll-and-11ty\">1. Comparing the Basics of Jekyll and 11ty <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1.-comparing-the-basics-of-jekyll-and-11ty\"></a></h2>\n<p>Jekyll and 11ty are both static site generators that help build websites quickly and efficiently. However, they differ greatly in philosophy and usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jekyll</strong> is Ruby-based and is natively supported by GitHub Pages. It has long been a dominant player in the static site generator space, offering a wide range of plugins and themes that make it easy to get started.</li>\n<li><strong>11ty</strong>, on the other hand, is a newer, JavaScript-based static site generator. While it’s relatively young, it’s gaining attention for being flexible, fast, and seamlessly integrating with the JavaScript ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After comparing the two, I decided to switch to <strong>11ty</strong> to better meet my needs and suit my development environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2.-challenges-faced-when-switching-from-jekyll-to-11ty\">2. Challenges Faced When Switching from Jekyll to 11ty <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2.-challenges-faced-when-switching-from-jekyll-to-11ty\"></a></h2>\n<p>One of the most significant challenges I faced during the switch was <strong>adapting to a different ecosystem</strong>. Since Jekyll is Ruby-based, transitioning to the JavaScript-based 11ty involved a learning curve. Specifically, I had to <strong>replace or find alternatives</strong> for the <strong>Jekyll plugins and themes</strong> I had previously relied on.</p>\n<p>Additionally, 11ty is much more flexible in terms of <strong>directory and template structure</strong>, which meant I had to define a lot of the structure myself. While this flexibility is a benefit, it added a level of complexity compared to Jekyll, where many things are pre-configured. Some tasks that were straightforward in Jekyll required manual configuration in 11ty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3.-speed-improvements-with-11ty-compared-to-jekyll\">3. Speed Improvements with 11ty Compared to Jekyll <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#3.-speed-improvements-with-11ty-compared-to-jekyll\"></a></h2>\n<p>The most noticeable improvement after switching to 11ty was the <strong>build speed</strong>. With Jekyll, as the number of posts or images increased, so did the build time. In some cases, Jekyll took several minutes to build a large site, and I had to optimize it with plugins and additional configurations.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>11ty builds are incredibly fast</strong>. Even with dozens of posts, <strong>build times were reduced to just a few seconds</strong>, significantly speeding up my workflow. Since 11ty is JavaScript-based, it also integrates more naturally with client-side scripts, making the entire development process more efficient.</p>\n<p>This difference in performance was so tangible that it reinforced my decision to switch to 11ty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4.-dependencies-and-customization\">4. Dependencies and Customization <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#4.-dependencies-and-customization\"></a></h2>\n<p>Jekyll manages plugins and themes via Ruby Gems, which can be cumbersome for those unfamiliar with the Ruby ecosystem. I often encountered dependency issues and conflicts that took time to resolve, slowing down the development process.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>11ty’s JavaScript (Node.js) ecosystem</strong> made adding plugins and customizing configurations much easier. Since I’m more comfortable with JavaScript, integrating the necessary tools was straightforward and intuitive. Additionally, <strong>11ty’s framework-agnostic design</strong> gave me the freedom to structure my files and directories as I saw fit, enhancing my control over the site’s architecture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5.-the-benefits-and-growth-potential-of-11ty\">5. The Benefits and Growth Potential of 11ty <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#5.-the-benefits-and-growth-potential-of-11ty\"></a></h2>\n<p>Jekyll has been a reliable static site generator for years, but in recent times, its development has slowed. In contrast, <strong>11ty’s rapidly growing community</strong> and active development offer exciting potential for future features and improvements. The integration with the JavaScript ecosystem means there’s a wealth of resources and tools available that can be used to enhance my projects.</p>\n<p>One of 11ty’s other standout features is its <strong>support for multiple templating engines</strong>. While I primarily use Nunjucks, I appreciate the ability to switch to Liquid, Handlebars, or other engines as needed, which adds flexibility and efficiency to my workflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6.-conclusion\">6. Conclusion <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#6.-conclusion\"></a></h2>\n<p>Ultimately, I made the switch from Jekyll to 11ty for its <strong>speed, flexibility, and compatibility with JavaScript</strong>. While Jekyll is still a fantastic tool, I needed a solution that better aligned with my development preferences and project requirements. The seamless integration with the JavaScript ecosystem was a critical factor for me as a frontend developer.</p>\n<p><strong>The switch from Jekyll to 11ty</strong> has improved my workflow, provided a more flexible development environment, and I’m excited to continue expanding my blog using 11ty as it evolves in the future.</p>\n",

      "title": "The Pros and Cons of Using WebP for Blog Images",
      "content_html": "<h1 id=\"the-pros-and-cons-of-using-webp-for-blog-images\">The Pros and Cons of Using WebP for Blog Images <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-pros-and-cons-of-using-webp-for-blog-images\"></a></h1>\n<p>When managing a blog, choosing the right image format is crucial for improving <strong>page load speed</strong>, <strong>user experience</strong>, and even <strong>SEO performance</strong>. One of the newer image formats emerging in web development is <strong>WebP</strong>, a format developed by <strong>Google</strong> to provide both <strong>lossy</strong> and <strong>lossless</strong> compression.</p>\n<p>This blog post will explore the <strong>advantages and disadvantages of using WebP</strong> images for blogs. We’ll compare WebP to other common formats like JPEG, PNG, and GIF, and also take a look at how widely WebP is being adopted across the web.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"1.-what-is-webp%2C-and-how-widely-is-it-used%3F\">1. What is WebP, and How Widely is it Used? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1.-what-is-webp%2C-and-how-widely-is-it-used%3F\"></a></h2>\n<p>WebP is an <strong>image format introduced by Google in 2010</strong>, designed to offer a more efficient way to compress images without sacrificing quality. The format is based on the <strong>VP8 video codec</strong> and provides both lossy and lossless compression options.</p>\n<p>WebP stands out due to its <strong>smaller file sizes</strong>, which are typically much smaller than traditional formats like <strong>JPEG</strong>, <strong>PNG</strong>, and <strong>GIF</strong>. It also supports <strong>alpha transparency</strong> (like PNG) and <strong>animation</strong> (like GIF), making it highly versatile.</p>\n<h3 id=\"growing-popularity\">Growing Popularity <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#growing-popularity\"></a></h3>\n<p>Since its inception, WebP has gained significant traction. As of 2024, it is supported by all major web browsers, including <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Safari</strong>, <strong>Firefox</strong>, and <strong>Edge</strong>. According to Google’s advocacy for WebP, the format is now used by many high-traffic websites to optimize performance, including <strong>e-commerce platforms</strong>, <strong>news outlets</strong>, and <strong>content-heavy blogs</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2.-advantages-of-using-webp\">2. Advantages of Using WebP <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2.-advantages-of-using-webp\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"1)-smaller-file-sizes\">1) <strong>Smaller File Sizes</strong> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1)-smaller-file-sizes\"></a></h3>\n<p>One of WebP’s most attractive features is its ability to <strong>reduce file size</strong> dramatically without a noticeable loss in quality. In fact, WebP can provide a <strong>25–34% reduction</strong> in file size compared to JPEG images of similar quality.</p>\n<p>Smaller images mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster <strong>page load times</strong>,</li>\n<li>Improved <strong>mobile performance</strong>,</li>\n<li>Reduced <strong>bandwidth usage</strong>, which can be crucial for users with limited internet data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2)-lossy-and-lossless-compression\">2) <strong>Lossy and Lossless Compression</strong> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2)-lossy-and-lossless-compression\"></a></h3>\n<p>WebP offers both <strong>lossy</strong> and <strong>lossless</strong> compression modes. This flexibility allows designers and developers to select the right compression based on their needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lossy compression</strong>: Prioritizes reducing file size, ideal for images where minor quality loss is acceptable.</li>\n<li><strong>Lossless compression</strong>: Maintains perfect image fidelity, suitable for graphic elements or high-resolution photos.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3)-transparency-(alpha-channel)-support\">3) <strong>Transparency (Alpha Channel) Support</strong> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#3)-transparency-(alpha-channel)-support\"></a></h3>\n<p>WebP supports <strong>transparent backgrounds</strong> similar to <strong>PNG</strong>, but with a significant advantage: transparent WebP images are <strong>up to 26% smaller</strong> than their PNG counterparts. This makes WebP a great choice for <strong>logos</strong>, <strong>icons</strong>, and other elements that require transparency without sacrificing quality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4)-animation-capabilities\">4) <strong>Animation Capabilities</strong> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#4)-animation-capabilities\"></a></h3>\n<p>WebP also supports <strong>animated images</strong>, similar to <strong>GIFs</strong>, but at a much smaller size. In fact, animated WebP images can be <strong>64% smaller</strong> than GIFs. This is particularly useful for blogs or websites that use <strong>memes</strong>, <strong>animated banners</strong>, or <strong>small video clips</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3.-disadvantages-of-using-webp\">3. Disadvantages of Using WebP <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#3.-disadvantages-of-using-webp\"></a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"1)-browser-compatibility\">1) <strong>Browser Compatibility</strong> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#1)-browser-compatibility\"></a></h3>\n<p>While WebP is widely supported today, <strong>older browsers</strong> (such as <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>) do not support the format. To ensure compatibility across all platforms, developers must provide <strong>fallback formats</strong> like <strong>JPEG</strong> or <strong>PNG</strong> to display images in browsers that do not support WebP.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2)-conversion-and-tooling-challenges\">2) <strong>Conversion and Tooling Challenges</strong> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#2)-conversion-and-tooling-challenges\"></a></h3>\n<p>Despite WebP’s advantages, not all image-editing software supports the format natively. Some tools may require <strong>additional plugins</strong> or converters to handle WebP images. This can slow down workflow for developers or designers who regularly edit and modify images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3)-potential-image-quality-loss\">3) <strong>Potential Image Quality Loss</strong> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#3)-potential-image-quality-loss\"></a></h3>\n<p>For images that require <strong>high-resolution details</strong>, using WebP’s <strong>lossy compression</strong> can sometimes result in <strong>noticeable quality degradation</strong> compared to PNG or JPEG. Fine details, textures, and color transitions can be lost, so it’s essential to choose the right compression settings based on the image content.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"4.-comparison-of-webp-with-other-formats\">4. Comparison of WebP with Other Formats <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#4.-comparison-of-webp-with-other-formats\"></a></h2>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at how WebP stacks up against other common image formats:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Image Format</strong></th>\n<th><strong>File Size</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Compression Type</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Transparency</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Animation</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Best Use Cases</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>JPEG</strong></td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Lossy</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Photographs, complex images</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>PNG</strong></td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Lossless</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Graphics, logos, icons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>GIF</strong></td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Lossless</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Simple animations, low-color images</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>WebP</strong></td>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>Lossy &amp; Lossless</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>All-in-one (photos, graphics, animations)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"key-takeaways%3A\">Key Takeaways: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#key-takeaways%3A\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>JPEG</strong> excels at compressing photographs but doesn’t support transparency.</li>\n<li><strong>PNG</strong> offers lossless compression and transparency but results in larger file sizes.</li>\n<li><strong>GIF</strong> is limited by its color palette and large file sizes for animation.</li>\n<li><strong>WebP</strong> offers <strong>all-in-one capabilities</strong> (transparency, animation, lossy/lossless compression) with much smaller file sizes.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"5.-adoption-trends-for-webp\">5. Adoption Trends for WebP <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#5.-adoption-trends-for-webp\"></a></h2>\n<p>WebP’s adoption has been steadily growing since its introduction in 2010. Early adoption was slow due to <strong>compatibility issues</strong> and <strong>limited tool support</strong>, but WebP is now widely accepted. Google actively promotes WebP in tools like <strong>PageSpeed Insights</strong> and <strong>Google Lighthouse</strong>, recommending it as a best practice for optimizing website performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"industry-usage\">Industry Usage <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#industry-usage\"></a></h3>\n<p>Leading tech companies and platforms, such as <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong>, have adopted WebP as their default image format due to its efficiency in saving bandwidth and improving page load speeds. Many <strong>WordPress</strong> plugins and <strong>CMS platforms</strong> now provide built-in WebP support.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#conclusion\"></a></h2>\n<p>WebP is a game-changing image format that strikes an ideal balance between <strong>small file sizes</strong> and <strong>image quality</strong>. While it’s still necessary to consider <strong>fallback formats</strong> for older browsers, WebP offers significant advantages over traditional formats like <strong>JPEG</strong>, <strong>PNG</strong>, and <strong>GIF</strong>. Whether you’re focused on <strong>speeding up page load times</strong>, reducing <strong>bandwidth usage</strong>, or optimizing images for <strong>mobile devices</strong>, WebP is becoming an essential tool in the web developer’s arsenal.</p>\n<p>For blogs and websites looking to improve performance without sacrificing quality, <strong>WebP</strong> is a format worth adopting.</p>\n<hr>\n",
