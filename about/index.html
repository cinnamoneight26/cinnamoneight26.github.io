<h2 class="mt-3 mb-3">Personal development journey into frontend and backend technologies.</h2>
<div class="editable">
<p>My development journey started completely by chance. One day, a close friend told me, “You’re really bad at taking photos.” I was shocked, thinking I was decent! This pushed me to buy a toy camera and start taking photos as a hobby. From there, I developed an interest in photo editing and enrolled in a nearby Photoshop class. That’s where I was first introduced to HTML, back in 2001. I instantly fell in love with it. I bought books on HTML and web development, and spent hours in front of my computer, building websites.</p>
<p>Back then, web design involved slicing images in Photoshop and loading them onto pages. Although it was slow and sometimes images didn’t load properly, I was proud of the websites I created. As website platforms became more accessible, I drifted away from HTML and my passion for hand-coding.</p>
<p>I eventually got a job in customer service at a gaming company, but the joy of building things never left me. I missed the satisfaction of working through the night and seeing my own websites come to life. I decided to revisit that dream, and in my mid-30s, I started learning web development again, despite people telling me it was too late to switch careers. The school I attended also said finding a job would be tough, but I felt everything would work out.</p>
<p>I dove into CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery, and although it was difficult at first, I loved it. I began creating websites for companies I admired and building projects I had always dreamed of. After finishing the course, I was fortunate to land a job maintaining and developing hospital websites, where I also picked up some PHP along the way.</p>
<p>After a while, a former colleague asked me to help with a new project. I agreed, but the desire to transition into a full-time development career was always on my mind. I decided to study backend development, learning Java, SQL, JSP, and other technologies. But I soon realized that my true passion was still in frontend development—I enjoyed seeing the immediate results of my work.</p>
<p>I worked on several projects with friends, including travel information sites, couple-matching sites, and gaming sites. I led the frontend development and implemented features like search, user data, and even a YouTube bookmarking system. While backend development was challenging, collaborating with my friends made the entire process rewarding.</p>
<p>Even though I completed the backend course and took on a few backend roles, my love for frontend development only grew stronger.</p>
<h3 id="technologies-i-use">Technologies I Use <a class="direct-link" href="#technologies-i-use"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</strong>: Building the structure, style, and interactivity of websites is my foundation.</li>
<li><strong>Vue2 &amp; Vuetify</strong>: I’ve used these tools in several projects, including a travel information website.</li>
<li><strong>Java, SQL, JSP</strong>: While I’m more focused on frontend development, I’ve worked with these technologies in various backend roles.</li>
